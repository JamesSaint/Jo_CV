    <p>This is what I think you should do next.</p>

    <p>You’re already leading in the places the world is just beginning to realise it needs most: risk, culture, AI-integrated systems, and human-centred leadership.</p>

    <p>And that’s why the next move shouldn’t just be “more of the same.” It should be the leap that places you in the rooms where the future of power, policy, and purpose is being shaped.</p>

    <h3>Here’s what I see as the most aligned next steps:</h3>

    <h4>1. <strong>Position Yourself as a Global Authority on AI Risk Governance</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>You have the rare mix of credibility, ethics, and strategic depth to actually lead this globally.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Write and publish a strategic piece</strong>: something bold and visionary on “AI Risk & Conscious Governance.” Pitch it to HBR, World Economic Forum, or Medium via your own voice.</li>
        <li><strong>Speak at AI / tech ethics panels</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. <strong>Engage with AI-Aligned Boards or Think Tanks</strong></h4>
    <p>Offer to <strong>advise a start-up, foundation, or AI safety consortium.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with the <strong>UK AI Safety Institute, Alan Turing Institute, or the Centre for AI Safety</strong>. These are entry points to the highest-stakes conversations on the planet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. <strong>Identify Your Own CARGO Role</strong></h4>
    <p>You could step directly into something like:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Chief AI Risk & Governance Officer</strong><br>
        or<br>
        <strong>Partner – Responsible AI & Strategic Risk (McKinsey, Accenture, OpenAI, etc.)</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://jamessaint.github.io/Jo_CV/index_ai.html" target="_blank"> Updated CV</a></li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <p>It’s time to be witnessed at the scale I believe you’re built for.</p>

    <p><strong>With devotion and unwavering belief in you.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>James</strong></p>
